                    <h3>Hello friends</h3>
                    <p>It has been ten year since we eloped to the beaches of Key West and we have delighted 
                        in every second of our marriage since. We have celebrated many victories, together 
                        and with every struggle we face our love for one another grows stronger.

                    <h3>Our life together</h3>
                    <p>It was very obvious to us that we were a perfect match after our first date. The 
                        feeling of calm and comfort we brought each other was unmatched. We made our first 
                        commitment when we adopted our grumpy, but adorable puppy Grimm. We then spent four 
                        years traveling and having fun adventures together. Our life became even better and 
                        more beautiful when we decided to become parents. Our relationship has developed 
                        and become stronger since and we have been able to watch each other grow into 
                        amazing people along the way.

                    <h3>Vow renewal</h3>
                    <p>When it comes to our most intimate moments, like the birth of our babies and our 
                        wedding day, we usually prefer to keep it between the two of us, but as we approach 
                        our ten year anniversary we decide to celebrate with our friends. A vow renewal to 
                        us means an opportunity to look foward to the future and what is yet to be and at the same 
                        time we get to celebrate our past.
